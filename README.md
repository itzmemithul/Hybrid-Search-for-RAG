# Hybrid Search with Pinecone Vector Database
Hybrid search is an advanced search methodology that combines multiple techniques to provide more accurate and comprehensive results. By blending traditional keyword-based search with semantic search, hybrid search bridges the gap between conventional and state-of-the-art search techniques.

This repository is a resource for those exploring hybrid search techniques with a focus on vector databases. It includes a detailed Jupyter Notebook and the necessary dependencies to help you understand and build a hybrid search solution using Pinecone, a high-performance vector database

# Features
- Hybrid Search Techniques: Combines traditional keyword search with dense vector search.

- Vector Database Integration: Uses Pinecone to store and query embeddings efficiently.

- Natural Language Processing: Leverages NLP techniques for better understanding and context-aware search results.

- Hands-on Guide: A detailed, step-by-step Jupyter Notebook to guide users through the development process.

# Contents
1. Hybrid_search_langchain_pinecone.ipynb
This notebook provides:

- An introduction to hybrid search concepts.

- Code examples to set up and query a Pinecone vector database.

- Demonstrations of combining vector-based search with traditional keyword search for enhanced results.
